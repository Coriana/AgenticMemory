# Agentic Memory 🧠

A novel agentic memory system for LLM agents that can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way.

## Introduction 🌟

Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex real-world tasks through external tool usage. However, to effectively leverage historical experiences, they require sophisticated memory systems. Traditional memory systems, while providing basic storage and retrieval functionality, often lack advanced memory organization capabilities.

Our project introduces an innovative **Agentic Memory** system that revolutionizes how LLM agents manage and utilize their memories:

## Key Features ✨

- 🔄 Dynamic memory organization based on Zettelkasten principles
- 🔍 Intelligent indexing and linking of memories
- 📝 Comprehensive note generation with structured attributes
- 🌐 Interconnected knowledge networks
- 🔄 Continuous memory evolution and refinement
- 🤖 Agent-driven decision making for adaptive memory management

## Framework 🏗️

[Framework figure will be added here]

## How It Works 🛠️

When a new memory is added to the system:
1. Generates comprehensive notes with structured attributes
2. Creates contextual descriptions and tags
3. Analyzes historical memories for relevant connections
4. Establishes meaningful links based on similarities
5. Enables dynamic memory evolution and updates

## Results 📊

Empirical experiments conducted on six foundation models demonstrate superior performance compared to existing SOTA baselines.
